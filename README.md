# Global Sales Performance Dashboard â€“ Power BI + Power Apps

## Project Objective
To build an interactive and user-friendly Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI, allowing users to analyze global sales trends, monitor key KPIs, and run real-time simulations through What-If analysis and Power Apps integration for better business decision-making.

## Dataset Used
-<a href="https://github.com/maysherai/Sales-Analysis--Dashboard/blob/main/Sales%20Records%201.csv">Data Source</a>

## Tools & Technologies
-Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualizations, What-If Analysis)

-Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)

-Power Apps (Input forms for real-time simulation)

-SharePoint / Dataverse (for backend simulation inputs)

## Key Features
-KPI Cards: Total Revenue, Total Profit, Units Sold, Profit Margin

-Interactive Slicers: Year, Region, Country, Sales Channel, Item Type

-Visuals:

  Map: Units Sold by Region

  Pie & Donut Charts: Order Priority, Sales Channel

  Line Chart: Revenue vs. Cost vs. Profit over time

  Bar Charts: Top Profitable Regions & Products

-What-If Analysis: Simulate pricing scenarios using DAX parameters

-Power Apps Integration: Users can input custom values (e.g., price or cost) and immediately see impact on profit

## Business Impact
-Improved insight into sales performance across regions and product categories

-Enabled dynamic scenario testing for better decision-making

-Reduced manual forecasting efforts through live input and simulation
